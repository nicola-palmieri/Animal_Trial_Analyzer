# üß™ Table Analyzer

The **Table Analyzer** is a Shiny dashboard that guides veterinary teams from raw monitoring spreadsheets to exploratory statistics, downloadable model summaries, and publication-ready visualisations. The code in this repository reflects the current production app and is ready to run locally in R.

## üìå Project status

- **Maturity:** Stable for routine use in-house. Feature work is ongoing, but the current UI/UX mirrors the deployed tool.
- **Deployment:** No hosted instance is shipped in this repository‚Äîrun locally via `app.R` or publish to your own Shiny Server / Posit Connect deployment.
- **Maintenance:** Issues and feature requests are handled on a rolling basis. Contributions are welcome through pull requests.

---

## üöÄ Quick start

### Requirements

- R 4.2 or newer.
- The CRAN packages loaded in [`app.R`](app.R): `bslib`, `dplyr`, `DT`, `flextable`, `GGally`, `ggplot2`, `lmerTest`, `officer`, `patchwork`, `shiny`, `shinyjqui`, `skimr`, and `tidyr`.

Install any missing packages with:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "bslib", "dplyr", "DT", "flextable", "GGally", "ggplot2", "lmerTest",
  "officer", "patchwork", "shiny", "shinyjqui", "skimr", "tidyr"
))
```

### Run the app locally

1. Open the project in RStudio or start an R session in the repository root.
2. Source `app.R` or click **Run App** in RStudio.
3. Navigate the four guided tabs (`Upload ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Visualize`).

Sample workbooks in [`data/`](data) demonstrate the expected long- and wide-format inputs.

## üß≠ Guided workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload

- Supports Excel workbooks (`.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.xlsm`).
- Provides templates for long and two-row wide layouts before you upload.
- Displays a 5-row preview with detected column types so you can verify the import.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Filter

- Filter by any column (categorical, numeric, logical).
- Apply range filters, include/exclude factor levels, and keep notes columns for context.
- The filtered dataset is shared with every downstream analysis module.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze

Select from the following analysis modules‚Äîeach ships with bespoke configuration inputs and downloadable reports:

| Module | Typical use case | Key outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Quick cohort summaries before modelling | Flextable summary tables, missingness and distribution diagnostics |
| **One-way ANOVA** | Compare one categorical factor | Type III ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc tests, per-response DOCX exports |
| **Two-way ANOVA** | Factorial designs (e.g. treatment √ó time) | Type III ANOVA, interaction plots, combined DOCX exports |
| **Linear Model (LM)** | Continuous covariates or additive fixed effects | Model summary, ANOVA table, diagnostic plots |
| **Linear Mixed Model (LMM)** | Repeated measures or clustered designs | `lmerTest` fit, intraclass correlation, diagnostics, Word export |
| **Pairwise Correlation** | Explore multivariate biomarker panels | `GGally::ggpairs` matrix with scatter, density, and correlation cells |
| **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | Dimensionality reduction and outlier checks | Scree plots, loadings tables, biplots |

Advanced options allow response batching, stratified analyses (up to 10 strata), manual factor ordering, and templated report downloads for each response/stratum combination.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualize

- Generates mean ¬± standard error plots that respect the selected model structure and strata.
- Automatically adapts layout controls for ANOVA grids, correlation matrices, and PCA biplots.
- Lets you override panel dimensions and grid arrangements before downloading high-resolution PNG files.

## üìã Preparing your workbook

| Column | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `animal_id` | Unique identifier | `Cow-101` |
| `treatment_group` | Allocation or protocol | `Vaccine A` |
| `time_point` | Sampling moment | `Day 14` |
| `outcome_measure` | Primary outcome | `EPG` |
| Additional outcomes | Numeric measurements (e.g., FAMACHA, weight, serology) | `3.5` |
| Optional notes | Clinical observations | `Mild swelling at injection site` |

- **Long format:** one row per measurement, per animal, per time point.
- **Wide format:** two header rows (outcome name + replicate); the app reshapes to long format for you.
- Use consistent naming (underscores over spaces) and harmonise factor levels to avoid filtering mismatches.

---

## üì¶ Outputs

- **Word reports (`.docx`)** for every model tab, capturing statistical tables, diagnostics, and stratified summaries.
- **PNG figures** sized according to your chosen layout (300‚ÄØdpi by default) for inclusion in reports or presentations.
- Auto-generated filenames include the analysis type, response variable, and date stamp for easy archiving.

## üõ† Troubleshooting & tips

| Issue | What to check | Suggested fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload fails | File is not Excel or is password protected | Save as `.xlsx` without protection and retry |
| Columns missing | Header spelling differs or trailing spaces exist | Normalise headers (e.g., `janitor::clean_names()`) |
| Filters remove all rows | Filters exclude every record | Reset filters or widen numeric bounds |
| Model errors | Groups have too few observations or random effects are singular | Simplify the model or collect more data per level |
| Flat plots | Little variation in the selected outcome | Verify data entry or consider transformations |

- Pair quantitative outputs with clinical notes to interpret biological relevance.
- Confirm random-effect identifiers (e.g., `animal_id`) match the true grouping structure before running LMMs.
- Save exported documents to your case management system for audit trails.
